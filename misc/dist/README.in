Many sites will find it useful to maintain a local copy of the OpenHPC
repositories. To facilitate this, we provide Tar archives-- one containing a 
repository of binary packages as well as any available updates, and one 
containing a repository of source RPMS. The tar file also contains a small bash
script to configure @PACKGE_MANAGER@ to use the local repository. Simply unpack
the tarball where you would like to host the local repository and execute the
make_repo script.

# ls /opt/ohpc/repos
@DISTRO@  mk_repo  OpenHPC-@VERSION_MICRO@.@DISTRO@_@ARCH@.tar OpenHPC.local.repo

# ./mk_repo 
--> Creating OpenHPC.local.repo file in @PACAGE_MANAGER_DIR@
--> Local repodata stored in /opt/ohpc/repos

# cat @PACAGE_MANAGER_DIR@/OpenHPC.local.repo
