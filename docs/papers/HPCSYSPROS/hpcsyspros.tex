% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in

\begin{abstract}
OpenHPC is a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project whose mission is to provide
an integrated collection of HPC-centric software components that can be used to 
implement a full-featured reference HPC compute resource. Components span
the entire HPC software ecosystem including provisioning and system
administration tools, resource management, I/O services, development tools,
numerical libraries, and performance analysis tools.

Common clustering tools and scientific libraries are distributed as 
pre-built and validated binaries and are meant to seamlessly layer on top of 
existing Linux distributions. The architecture of OpenHPC is intentionally 
modular to allow end users to pick and choose from the provided components, as 
well as to foster a community of open contribution.

Packaging conventions, build and release infrastructure, and validation 
methodologies are described. We show how OpenHPC can be used to provision a 
fully usable compute cluster and execute a typical benchmark workload.

\section{Introduction}

\section{OpenHPC: Community building blocks for HPC systems}

\subsection{Motivation}
Many HPC sites spend considerable effort aggregating a large suite of 
open-source projects to provide a capable HPC environment for their users.
It is necessary to build and deploy HPC focused packages that are either absent
or outdated in Linux distro providers. Further, local packaging or 
customization frequently tries to give software versioning access to users (e.g.
via environment modules or similar equivalent). OpenHPC is focused on 
lowering the barrier to entry for HPC by providing a collection of 
pre-packaged and validated binary components that can be used to install 
and manage HPC clusters throughout their lifecycle. We also provide multiple 
system configuration recipes that leverage community reference designs and best 
practices.

\subsection{Community}
Linux Foundation + governance + TSC + members

\subsection{Conventions}
RPM + module + test

\subsection{Infrastructure}
Github + OBS + Jenkins

\subsection{Usage}
Yum install my cluster

\section{Conclusions \& Future work}
More Components + Optimizations + More Architectures

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
the .tex source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
