Known Issues:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Affected OS: CenOS7.x

Notes:       FSP uses the Open Build Service (OBS) to orchestrate the
             build process for multiple OS distributions and to define
             convenience groups for installation. There is a known
             problem with accessing OBS defined yum groups that
             requires augmenting a yum config file after it is
             downloaded from the FSP repository.

             See the companion Install Guide for information on the
             work-around.
