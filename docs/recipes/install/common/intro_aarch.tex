There are some known issues around \OHPC{} packages targeted for use on 64-bit
ARM-based architectures. A running log of errata and
fixes can be found at the
\href{https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/ARM-Tech-Preview}{\color{blue}{ARM Tech Preview Wiki}}.

\noindent Known Package Issues: 
\begin{itemize*}

\item GSL: a small subset of tests performed with the GSL library failed
precision related tests. This is currently attributed to the fact that the tests included
in GSL are tuned for x86 which does 80-bit extended precision.
\item PAPI: hardware counter availability may not be available depending on the
underlying ARM platform.
\item MPI: The hardware used for validating this Tech Preview release contained
only ethernet. The available MPI stacks reflect this test environment.
\item Lustre: since various ARM platforms require different kernels than the
standard ones provided by the SLES-12-SP2 and CentOS-7.3 distributions, 
building a lustre client that would work for these specific platform 
configurations was beyond the scope of this release.
\end{itemize*}
