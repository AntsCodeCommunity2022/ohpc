With the resource manager enabled for production usage, users should now be
able to run jobs.  Recall that we added a ``test'' user on the {\em master}
host in \S\ref{sec:add_rm} that can now be used to run an example test job.
\OHPC{} includes a simple ``hello-world'' MPI application in the
\texttt{/opt/ohpc/pub/examples} directory that can be used for this quick
compilation and execution.  To use the test account to compile and execute the
application interactively through the resource manager, execute the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
# switch to "test" user
[master](*\#*) su - test

# Compile MPI "hello world" example
[test@master ~]$ mpicc -o hello -O3 /opt/ohpc/pub/examples/mpi/hello.c

# Submit interactive job request and use prun to launch executable
[test@master ~]$ srun -n 8 -N 2 --pty /bin/bash

[test@c1 ~]$ prun ./hello

[prun] Master compute host = c1
[prun] Launch cmd = mpiexec.hydra -bootstrap slurm ./hello

 Hello, world (8 procs total)
    --> Process #   0 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   4 of   8 is alive. -> c2
    --> Process #   1 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   5 of   8 is alive. -> c2
    --> Process #   2 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   6 of   8 is alive. -> c2
    --> Process #   3 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   7 of   8 is alive. -> c2
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, a simple batch script can be written and submitted to the
scheduler using sbatch to run when nodes become available. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[test@master ~]$ cat hello.script
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J hi # Job name
#SBATCH -o job.%j.out # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -N 2 # Total number of nodes requested (16 cores/node)
#SBATCH -n 8 # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 01:30:00 # Run time (hh:mm:ss) - 1.5 hours

prun ./hello
[test@master ~]$ sbatch hello.script
Submitted batch job 339
[test@master ~]$ cat job.339.out
[prun] Master compute host = c1
[prun] Launch cmd = mpiexec.hydra -bootstrap slurm hostname
 Hello, world (8 procs total)
    --> Process #   0 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   4 of   8 is alive. -> c2
    --> Process #   1 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   5 of   8 is alive. -> c2
    --> Process #   2 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   6 of   8 is alive. -> c2
    --> Process #   3 of   8 is alive. -> c1
    --> Process #   7 of   8 is alive. -> c2
\end{lstlisting}
