This guide documents a simple cluster installation procedure using components
from the internal Forest Peak (FSP) 2014 checkpoint. While this documentation
is intended to be reasonably generic, it is targeted for reproducibility on the
internal {\em Zeus} cluster at Intel, and requires access to RPM repositories that are made
available by the FSP Open Build Service (OBS) instance that is used to build
and package components. Note: this process is not meant to dictate a
specific, final FSP implementation or installation direction; instead, it
serves as a learning vehicle and demonstrates the ability to use the 2014 FSP
checkpoint to install a small, working cluster.
