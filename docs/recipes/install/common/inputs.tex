\subsection{Inputs}
As this recipe details installing a cluster
starting from bare-metal, there is a requirement to define IP addresses and gather
hardware MAC addresses in order to support a controlled provisioning process. These values
are necessarily unique to the hardware being used, and this document uses
variable substituion (\texttt{\$\{variable\}})
in the command-line examples that follow to highlight where local site
inputs are required. A summary of the required variables used in this recipe
are as follows: \\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{@{}>{\textbullet}cll@{}}
& \texttt{\$\{master\_name\}}  & {\small \# Hostname for master server} \\
& \texttt{\$\{master\_ip\}} & {\small \# Local private IP address on master server}  \\
& \texttt{\$\{sms\_eth\_internal\}} & {\small \# Internal ethernet interface on SMS} \\
& \texttt{\$\{eth\_provision\}} & {\small \# Provisioning interface for computes} \\
& \texttt{\$\{internal\_netmask\}} & {\small \# Subnet netmask for internal cluster network} \\
& \texttt{\$\{bmc\_username\}} & {\small \# BMC username for use by IPMI} \\
& \texttt{\$\{bmc\_password\}} & {\small \# BMC password for use by IPMI} \\
& \texttt{\$\{c1\_ip\}},\texttt{\$\{c2\_ip\}},\texttt{\$\{c3\_ip\}},\texttt{\$\{c4\_ip\}}
& {\small \# Desired compute node addresses} \\
& \texttt{\$\{c1\_bmc\}},\texttt{\$\{c2\_bmc\}},\texttt{\$\{c3\_bmc\}},\texttt{\$\{c4\_bmc\}}
& {\small \# BMC addresses for computes} \\
& \texttt{\$\{c1\_mac\}},\texttt{\$\{c2\_mac\}},\texttt{\$\{c3\_mac>\}},\texttt{\$\{c4\_mac\}}
& {\small \# MAC addresses for computes} \\
& \texttt{\$\{mgs\_fs\_name\}} & {\small \# Lustre MGS mount name (\em Optional)} \\
& \texttt{\$\{sms\_ipoib\}} & {\small \# IPoIB address for SMS server (\em Optional)} \\
& \texttt{\$\{ipoib\_netmask\}} & {\small \# Subnet netmask for internal IPoIB (\em Optional)} \\
& \texttt{\$\{c1\_ipoib\}},\texttt{\$\{c2\_ipoib\}},\texttt{\$\{c3\_ipoib\}},\texttt{\$\{c4\_ipoib\}}
