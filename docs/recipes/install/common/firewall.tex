Provisioning services with Warewulf rely on TFTP and HTTP transport protocols.
Depending on the local Base OS configuration on the SMS host, default firewall
rules may prohibit these services. Consequently, this recipe assumes that the local
firewall running on the SMS host is disabled. If installed, the default
firewall service can be disabled as follows:

% begin_fsp_run
% fsp_validation_comment Disable firewall 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[master]$ systemctl disable firewalld
[master]$ systemctl stop firewalld
\end{lstlisting}
% end_fsp_run
