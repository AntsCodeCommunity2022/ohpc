Recall the assumption that the {\em master} host has a working DNS configuration. To be 
sure, let's add the {\em master} IP address and hostname to the (\texttt{/etc/hosts}) file. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[sms](*\#*) echo "${sms_ip} 	${sms_name}" >> /etc/hosts
\end{lstlisting}

The following command adds the \rms{} workload manager server components to the
chosen {\em master} host. Note that client-side components will be added to
the corresponding compute image in a subsequent step.

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Add resource management services on master node \ref{sec:add_rm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[sms](*\#*) (*\install*) pbspro-server-ohpc
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run
