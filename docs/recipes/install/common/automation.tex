\subsection{Installation Template}
The collection of command-line instructions included in this guide, when
combined with local site inputs, can be used to implement a starting recipe for
bare-metal system installation and configuration. To aid in direct usage of the
commands called out in this particular recipe, and to also allow for potential
site customization, \FSP{} documentation includes a template script summarizing
the commands used herein. This script can be used in conjunction with a simple
text file that defines the local site variables defined in the previous section
(\S~\ref{sec:inputs}).

By default, the template install script attempts to use local variable settings sourced
from the \path{/opt/fsp/pub/docs/input.local} file, however, this choice can be
overridden by the use of the \texttt{FSP\_INPUT\_LOCAL} environment
variable. The template install script is intended for execution on the SMS {\em
  master} host and installed as part of the {\em docs-fsp} package into
\path{/opt/fsp/pub/docs/fsp_vanilla_recipe.sh}.  After reviewing the guide
for additional information on the intent of the commands, the general starting
approach for using this template is as follows:

%[rightmargin=2cm,itemsep=-0.5ex]
\begin{itemize*}
\item Copy the \path{/opt/fsp/pub/docs/input.local} example input file and edit the
  variable definitions to match desired local settings.
\item Review the \texttt{fsp\_vanilla\_recipe.sh} file which contains
  command-line instructions culled from this guide and edit to suite.
\item Execute the resulting script on chosen SMS host to perform a local installation.
\end{itemize*}
