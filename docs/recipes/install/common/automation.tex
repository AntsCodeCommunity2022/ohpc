\subsection{Installation template}
The collection of command-line instructions that follow in this guide, when
combined with local site inputs, can be used to implement a 
bare-metal system installation and configuration. The format of these commands
is intended to be usable via direct cut and paste (with variable substitution
for site-specific settings). Alternatively, the \FSP{} documentation package
includes a template script which includes a summary of all of the commands used
herein. This script can be used in conjunction with a simple text file to
define the local site variables defined in the previous section
(\S~\ref{sec:inputs}) and is provided as a convenience for administrators.  For
additional information on accessing this script, please see
Appendix~\ref{appendix:template_script}.

%% To aid in direct usage of the
%% commands called out in this particular recipe, and to also allow for potential
%% site customization, the \FSP{} documentation package includes a template script
%% summarizing the commands used herein.  

%% By default, the template install script attempts to use local variable settings
%% sourced from the \path{/opt/fsp/pub/doc/recipes/vanilla/input.local} file,
%% however, this choice can be overridden by the use of the
%% \texttt{FSP\_INPUT\_LOCAL} environment variable. The template install script is
%% intended for execution on the SMS {\em master} host and is installed as part of
%% the \texttt{docs-fsp} package into \path{/opt/fsp/pub/doc/recipes/vanilla/recipe.sh}.
%% After reviewing the guide for additional information on the intent of the
%% commands, the general starting approach for using this template is as follows:

%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item Install the \texttt{docs-fsp} package

%% \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
%% [master]$ (*\install*) docs-fsp
%% \end{lstlisting}

%% \item Copy the provided template input file to use as a starting point to
%%   define local site settings:
%% \begin{lstlisting}
%% [master]$ cp /opt/fsp/pub/doc/recipes/input.local.template input.local
%% \end{lstlisting}

%% \item Update \path{input.local} with desired settings

%% \item Copy the template installation script which contains comman-line
%%   instructions culled from this guide.

%% \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
%% [master]$ cp -p /opt/fsp/pub/doc/recipes/vanilla/recipe.sh .
%% \end{lstlisting}

%% \item Review and edit \path{recipe.sh} to suite.

%% \item Use environment variable to define local input file and execute
%%   \path{recipe.sh} to perform a local installation.

%% \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
%% [master]$ export FSP_INPUT_LOCAL=./input.local
%% [master]$ ./recipe.sh
%% \end{lstlisting}
%% \end{enumerate}
