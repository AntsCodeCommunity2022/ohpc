In addition to the 3rd party development libraries built using the open source
toolchains mentioned in \S\ref{sec:3rdparty}, \OHPC{} also provides {\em
  optional} compatible builds for use with the compilers and MPI stack included
in newer versions of the \IntelR{}~Parallel Studio XE software suite.  These
packages provide a similar hierarchical user
environment experience as other compiler and MPI families present in \OHPC{}.

To take advantage of the available builds, the Parallel Studio software suite
must be obtained and installed separately. Once installed locally, the \OHPC{}
compatible packages can be installed using standard package manager semantics.
Note that licenses are provided free of charge for many categories of use. In
particular, licenses for compilers and developments tools are provided at no
cost to academic researchers or developers contributing to open-source software
projects. More information on this program can be found at:

To enable all 3rd party builds available in \OHPC{} that are compatible with
\IntelR{}~Parallel Studio, issue the following:
