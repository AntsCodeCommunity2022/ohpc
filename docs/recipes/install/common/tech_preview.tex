\section{Tech Preview}

This guides highlights the initial availability of \OHPC{} packages intended
for use on 64-bit ARM-based architectures. This collection is being provided as
a {\bf Tech Preview} release initially, as there are some known issues around
provisioning and a subset of development packages.
%will be highlighted below.

This guide follows the general installation steps layed out in other companion
\OHPC{} recipes.  However, the provisioning steps as outlined with Warewulf
(most of the steps in \S~\ref{sec:add_provisioning} thru
\ref{sec:boot_computes}) are not directly usable without additional
modification to the PXE boot process.  Consequently, users interested in
leveraging packages from this Tech Preview are encouraged to enable the repo
(see \S~\ref{sec:enable_repo}) and install desired {\bf development}
compontents (\S~\ref{sec:install_dev}) on top of systems were the underlying
base OS is preinstalled. In addition, if multiple nodes are available, the
\rms{} resource manager can be used schedule resoruces. Future \OHPC{} releases
will expand on this tech preview to include validated recipes for a bare-metal
cluster install. \\

\noindent Specific Known Package Issues: 
\begin{itemize*}
\item GSL: a small subset of tests performed with the GSL library failed
  precision releated tests. This is currently attributed to the fact that the
  tests included in GSL are tuned for x86 which does 80-bit extended precision.
  \item PAPI: hardware counter availability may not be available depending on
    the underlying ARM platform
  \item MPI: available hardware for this Tech Preview release was {\em
    ethernet} only. The available MPI stacks reflect this test environment.
\end{itemize*}
