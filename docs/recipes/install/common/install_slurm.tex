The following command adds the \SLURM{} workload manager server components to the
chosen {\em master} host. Note that client-side components will be added to
the corresponding compute image in a subsequent step.

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Add resource management services on master node \ref{sec:add_rm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[master](*\#*) (*\groupinstall*) ohpc-slurm-server
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run

\SLURM{} requires the designation of a system user that runs the underlying
resource management daemons. The default configuration file that is supplied
with the \OHPC{} build of \SLURM{} identifies this \texttt{SlurmUser} to be a
dedicated user named \texttt{slurm} and this user must exist. 
The following command can be used to add this user to the {\em
  master} server:

% begin_ohpc_run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[master](*\#*) useradd slurm
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run

To facilitate running test jobs later on under the auspices of a resource
manager, we also add a dedicated ``test'' user as follows:

% begin_ohpc_run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[master](*\#*) useradd -m test
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run
