In an external setting, installing the desired BOS on a {\em master} host 
typically involves booting from a DVD iso image on a new server. If following
this approach for a new system, insert the \baseOS{} DVD, power cycle the host,
and follow the distro provided directions to install the BOS on your chosen
{\em master} host.  Alternatively, if you choose to use a pre-installed server,
verify that it is provisioned with the required \baseOS{} distribution.

%%%However, on
%%%the Zeus cluster, master nodes can be network booted with a minimal OS install
%%%using an external {\em Warewulf} instance. The Warewulf configuration
%%%provisions the OS into a ramdisk, configures local package repositories to
%%%point to the FSP OBS server and underlying distro repos, and mounts an
%%%NFS \$HOME file system. With this setup, all that is required to achieve a
%%%clean BOS install on a master host is to perform a host reboot. If, however, you
%%%are installing a new system, insert the \baseOS{} DVD, power cycle the host,
%%%and follow the distro provided directions to install the BOS on your chosen
%%%{\em master} host.
