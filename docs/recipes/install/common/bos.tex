In an external setting, installing the desired BOS on a {\em master} host 
typically involves booting from a DVD iso image on a new server. With this 
approach, insert the \baseOS{} DVD, power cycle the host, and follow the 
distro provided directions to install the BOS on your chosen {\em master} host. 
Alternatively, if one chooses to use a pre-installed server, verify that it is 
provisioned with the required \baseOS{} distribution.
