In an external setting, installing the desired BOS on a {\em master} SMS host
typically involves booting from a DVD ISO image on a new server. With this
approach, insert the \baseOS{} DVD, power cycle the host, and follow the distro
provided directions to install the BOS on your chosen {\em master} host.
Alternatively, if choosing to use a pre-installed server, please verify that it
is provisioned with the required \baseOS{} distribution.

While it is theoretically possible to provision a Warewulf cluster with SELinux
enabled, doing so is beyond the scope of this document. Even the use of
permissive mode can be problematic and we therefore recommend disabling SELinux on the {\em
master} SMS host. If SELinux components are installed locally,
the \texttt{selinuxenabled} command can be used to determine if SELinux is
currently enabled. If enabled, consult the distro documentation for information
on how to disable.
