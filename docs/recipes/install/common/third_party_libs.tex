\OHPC{}-provided 3rd party builds are configured to be installed
into a common top-level repository so that they can be easily exported to
desired hosts within the cluster. This common top-level path
(\path{/opt/ohpc/pub}) was previously configured to be mounted on {\em
 compute} nodes in \S\ref{sec:master_customization}, so the packages will be
immediately available for use on the cluster after installation on the {\em
 master} host.

For convenience, \OHPC{} provides package aliases for these 3rd party libraries
and utilities that can be used to install all of the available libraries for
use with the GNU compiler family toolchain (and associated MPI family
permutations when applicable). To install available package offerings within \OHPC{},
issue the following:
