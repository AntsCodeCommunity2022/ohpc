\noindent {\bf Requirements}: this recipe assumes the availability of a single head node
{\em master}, and four {\em compute} nodes. The {\em master} node is
provisioned with \baseOS{} and is subsequently configured to provision the
remaining {\em compute} nodes with Warewulf* in a stateless configuration. We
assume an external \$HOME file system is available for use on both the master
and compute nodes (via either NFS* or Lustre*), and that compute node BMCs are
available via IPMI from the chosen master host.
