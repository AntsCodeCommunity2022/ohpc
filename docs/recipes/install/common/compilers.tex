\OHPC{} presently packages two compiler families ({\GNU{}} and {\Intel{}
  Parallel Studio}) that are integrated within the underlying
modules-environment system in a hierarchical fashion. End users of a \OHPC{}
system can choose to access one compiler at a time and will be presented with
additional compiler-dependent software as a function of which compiler
toolchain is currently loaded. Each compiler toolchain can be installed
separately and the following commands illustrate the installation of both along
with any necessary dependencies:

% begin_ohpc_run
% fsp_comment_header Install Compilers \ref{sec:install_compilers}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[master]$ (*\install*) gnu-compilers-ohpc intel-compilers-devel-ohpc
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run
