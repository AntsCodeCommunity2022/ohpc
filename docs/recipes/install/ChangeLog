   [Known Issues]

      * the currently packaged version of OpenMPI was observed to intermittently hang during repeated job execution on
        True Scale fabrics. For True Scale fabrics, we suggest setting the following environment variables:

	export OMPI_MCA_pml=cm
	export OMPI_MCA_mtl=psm

        This is a known issue that has been resolved in a newer release of OpenMPI.
