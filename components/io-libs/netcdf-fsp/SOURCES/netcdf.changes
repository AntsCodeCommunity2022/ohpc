- fix license for spdx 1.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  1 21:17:08 UTC 2014 - ocefpaf@gmail.com

- update to 4.3.2
  *  Improved type handling with respect to fill-values.
  *  Enabled netCDF-4 bit-for-bit reproducibility for nccopy and other
     applications (thanks to Rimvydas Jasinskas and Quincey Koziol).
  *  Improved cmake build process.
  *  As part of an ongoing project, the Doxygen-generated netCDF documentation
     has been reorganized. The goal is to make the documentation easier to
     parse, and to eliminate redundant material.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 10 16:31:45 UTC 2014 - opensuse@dstoecker.de

- update to 4.3.1.1
  * Corrected a DAP issue reported by Jeff Whitaker related to
    non-conforming servers.
  * Corrected an issue with DAP tests failing in a 64-bit Cygwin
    environment. NCF-286
  * Add an extended format inquiry method to the netcdf API:
    nc_inq_format_extended. NC_HAVE_INQ_FORMAT_EXTENDED is defined
    in netcdf.h NCF-273
  * Fixed fill value handling for string types in nc4_get_vara().
  * Corrected behavior of nc_inq_unlimdim and nv_inq_unlimdims to
    report dimids in same order as nc_inq_dimids.
  * A number of previously-disabled unit tests were reviewed and
    made active.
  * When opening a netCDF-4 file, streamline the iteration over
    objects in the underlying HDF5 file.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 failure when renaming a dimension and renaming
    a variable using that dimension, in either order. NCF-177
  * When compiling with hdf4 support, both autotools and cmake-based
    builds now properly look for the libjpeg dependency and will link
    against it when found (or complain if it's not). Also added
    ENABLE_HDF4_FILE_TESTS option to CMake-based builds.
  * Fixed bug in ncgen; it was not properly filling empty string
    constants ("") to be the proper length. NCF-279
  * Fixed bug in ncgen where it was interpreting int64 constants as
    uint64 constants. NCF-278
  * Fixed bug in handling Http Basic Authorization. The code was
    actually there but was not being executed. NCF-277
  * Added hack to the DAP code to address a problem with the
    Columbia.edu server. That server does not serve up proper DAP2 DDS
    replies. The Dataset {...} name changes depending on if the request
    has certain kinds of constraints. NCF-276
  * Fixed bugs with ncdump annotation of values, using -b or -f
    options. NCF-275
  * Added better documentation about accessing ESG datasets. See
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/esg.html.
  * Corrected an issue with CMake-based builds enabling HDF4 support
    where the HDF4 libraries were in a non-standard location.
  * Fix bug introduced by NCF-267 where octal constants above '\177'
    were not recognized as proper octal constants. NCF-271
  * Fixed an issue where the netcdf.3 man page was not being installed
    by CMake-based builds. Github
  * Modify ncgen to support NUL characters in character array
    constants. NCF-267
  * Modify ncgen to support disambiguating references to an enum
    constant in a data list. NCF-265
  * Corrected bug in netCDF-4 dimension ID ordering assumptions,
    resulting in access that works locally but fails through DAP
    server. NCF-166
  * Ensure netCDF-4 compiles with OpenMPI as an alternative to
    MPICH2. NCF-160
  * Addressed issue with hanging Parallel netCDF-4 using HDF5 1.8.10.
    NCF-240
  * Removed deprecated directories:
        librpc/
        udunits/
        libcf/
        libcdmr/
  * Added configure and accompanying configuration files/templates to
    release repository. These will only be added to tagged releases
    on GitHub.
  * Integrated a fix by Quincey Koziol which addressed a variation of
    NCF-250, Fix issue of netCDF-4 parallel independent access with
    unlimited dimension hanging.
  * Integrated change contributed by Orion Poplawski which integrated
    GNUInstallDirs into the netCDF-C CMake system; this will permit
    systems that install into lib64 (such as Fedora) to make install
    without problem.
  * Corrected an error with the CMake config files that resulted in the
    netcdf.3 manpage not being built or installed.
  * Added nc_rename_grp to allow for group renaming in netCDF-4 files. NCF-204
  * Added a NC_HAVE_RENAME_GRP macro to netcdf.h, as per a request by
    Charlie Zender. This will allow software compiling against netcdf
    to easily query whether or not nc_rename_grp() is available.
  * Added Greg Sjaardema's contributed optimization for the nc4_find_dim_len
    function in libsrc4/nc4internal.c. The patch eliminates several
    malloc/free calls that exist in the original coding.
  * Added support for dynamic loading, to compliment the dynamic loading
    support introduced in hdf 1.8.11. Dynamic loading support depends on
    libdl, and is enabled as follows: NCF-258
        autotools-based builds: â€“enable-dynamic-loading
        cmake-based builds: -DENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING=ON
  * Fix issue of netCDF-4 parallel independent access with unlimited
    dimension hanging. Extending the size of an unlimited dimension in
    HDF5 must be a collective operation, so now an error is returned if
    trying to extend in independent access mode. NCF-250
  * Fixed bug with netCDF-4's inability to read HDF5 scalar numeric
    attributes. Also allow, in addition to zero length strings, a new
    NULL pointer as a string value. to improve interoperability with
    HDF5. This required a new CDL constant, 'NIL', that can be output
    from ncdump for such a string value in an HDF5 or netCDF-4 file.
    The ncgen utility was also modified to properly handle such NIL
    values for strings. NCF-56
  * Fix contributed by Nath Gopalaswamy to large file problem reading
    netCDF classic or 64-bit offset files that have a UINT32_MAX flag
    for large last record size of a variable that has values larger than
    1 byte. This problem had previously been fixed for writing such data,
    but was only tested with an ncbyte variable.
  * Fixed various minor documentation problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 12:53:54 UTC 2013 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 4.3.0
  * fsync: Changed default in autotools config file; fsync must
    now be explicitely enabled instead of explicitely disabled.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug where odometer code for libdap2 mishandled
    stride > 1. Bug reported by Ansley Manke.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug where netCDF would ignore the HDF5 reference
    type in the file, instead of rejecting the file as it should.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug with particular order of creation of
    dimensions, coordinate variables, and subgroups resulting in
    two dimensions with the same dimension ID.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug with a multidimensional coordinate variable
    in a subgroup getting the wrong dimension IDs for its
    dimensions.
  * Fixed bug with incorrect fixed-size variable offsets in header
    getting written when schema changed for files created by
    parallel-netcdf. Thanks to Wei-keng Liao for developing and
    contributing the fix.
  * Fixed bug in handling old servers that do not do proper
    Grid to Structure conversions.
  * Replaced the oc library with oc2.0
  * Fix bug with nc_get_var1_uint() not accepting unsigned ints
    larger than 2**31.
  * Fix to convert occurrences of '/' in DAP names to %2f.
  * Fix bug in netCDF-4 with scalar non-coordinate variables with
    same name as dimensions.
  * Fix bug in which calling netCDF-4 functions in which behavior
    that should not depend on order of calls sometimes produces
    the wrong results.
  * Merged in nccopy additions from Martin van Driel to support 
    -g and -v options for specifying which groups or variables are
    to be copied.
  * Merged in parallel-netcdf bugs fixes from Greg Sjaardema.
  * Modify ncgen so that if the incoming file has a special
    attribute, then it is used to establish the special property of
    the netcdf file, but the attribute is not included as a real
    attribute in the file..
  * Added library version info to the user-agent string so that the
    server logs will be more informative.
  * Added work around for bad servers that sometimes sends DAP
    dataset with duplicate field names.
  * Fixed bug with strided access for NC_STRING type.
  * Prevented adding an invalid _FillValue attribute to a variable
    (with nonmatching type or multiple values), to avoid later
    error when any record variable is extended.
  * Fix bug in which some uses of vlen within compounds causes HDF5
    errors.
  * Fixed ncdump bug in display of data values of variables that use 
    multiple unlimited dimensions.
  * Fix bug in which interspersing def_var calls with put_var calls
    can lead to corrupt metadata in a netCDF file with groups and
    inherited dimensions.
  * Building shared libraries works with DAP and netCDF4 
    functionality.
  * 32-and-64-bit builds are working under MinGW on Windows.
  * Config.h for Windows compiles are included in the build.
  * NetCDF-4 dependency on NC_MAX_DIMS has been removed.
  * 64-bit DLL's are produced on Windows.
  * DLL Packaging issues are resolved.
  * The CMake build system (with related ctest and cdash systems 
    for testing) has been integrated into netCDF-C. This allows for
    Visual Studio-based builds in addition to gcc-based builds.
    This requires at least CMake version 2.8.8. This 
    replaces/supplements the cross-compiled set of Visual-Studio
    compatible netCDF libraries introduced in netCDF 4.2.1-rc1.

Tue May 19 17:15:44 CEST 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 4.0.1
  * Added optional arguments to F90 API to nf90_open/create,
    nf90_create_var, and nf90_inquire_variable so that all netCDF-4
    settings may be accomplished with optional arguments, instead
    of separate function calls.
  * Added control of HDF5 chunk cache to allow for user performance
    tuning.
  * Added parallel example program in F90.
  * Changed default chunking to better handle very large variables.
  * Made contiguous the default for fixed size data sets with no
    filters.
  * Fixed bug in nc_inq_ncid; now it returns NC_ENOGRP if the named
    group is not found.
  * Fixed man pages for C and F77 so that netCDF-4 builds will
    result in man pages that document new netCDF-4 functions.
  * Added OPeNDAP support based on a new C-only implementation.
    This is enabled using --enable-dap option and requires libcurl.
    The configure script will attempt to locate libcurl, but if it
    fails, then its location must be specified by the --with-curl
    option.
  * Changed chunksizes to size_t from int.
  * Fixed fill value problem from F77 API.
  * Fixed problems in netcdf-4 files with multi-dimensional
    coordinate variables.
  * Fixed ncgen to properly handle CDL input that uses Windows line
    endings ("\r\n"), instead of getting a syntax error.
  * Added "-s" option to ncdump to display performance
    characterisitics of netCDF-4 files as special virtual attributes,
    such as _Chunking, _DeflateLevel, _Format, and _Endianness.
  * Added "-t" option to ncdump to display times in human readable
    form as strings.  Added code to interpret "calendar" attribute
    according to CF conventions, if present, in displaying
    human-readable times.
  * Added experimental version of ncgen4 capable of generating
    netcdf-4 data files and C code for creating them. In addition,
    it supports the special attributes _Format, etc.
  * Fixed Fortran 90 int64 problems.
  * Rewrote HDF5 read/write code in accordance with performance advice
    from Kent.
  * Fixed memory leaks in gets/puts of HDF5 data.
  * Fixed some broken tests for parallel I/O (i.e. MPI) builds.
  * Fixed some cross-compile problems.
  * Rewrote code which placed bogus errors on the HDF5 error stack,
    trying to open non-existant attributes and variables. Now no HDF5
    errors are seen.
  * Removed man subdirectory. Now man4 subdirectory is used for all
    builds.
  * Changed build so that users with access to parallel make can
    use it.
  * Added experimental support for accessing data through OPeNDAP
    servers using the DAP protocol (use --enable-opendap to build it).
  * Fixed ncdump bugs with array field members of compound type
    variables.  Fixed ncdump bug of assuming default fill value
    for data of type unsigned byte.
