In addition to the above customizations, when using InfiniBand as the
underlying high speed interconnect, it is generally necessary to increase the
locked memory settings for system users. This can be accomplished by updating
the \texttt{/etc/security/limits.conf} file and this should be performed within
the {{\em compute} image and on all job submission hosts. In this recipe, jobs
  are submitted from the {\em master} host, and the following commands can be
  used to update the maximum locked memory settings:

% begin_fsp_run
% fsp_validation_comment Update memlock on master
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={},upquote=true]
# Update memlock settings on master
[master]$ echo "* soft memlock unlimited" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
[master]$ echo "* hard memlock unlimited" >> /etc/security/limits.conf

# Update memlock settings within compute image
[master]$ echo "* soft memlock unlimited" >> $CHROOT/etc/security/limits.conf
[master]$ echo "* hard memlock unlimited" >> $CHROOT/etc/security/limits.conf
\end{lstlisting}
% end_fsp_run
