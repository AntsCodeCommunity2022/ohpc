At this point, the {\em master} server should be able to boot the newly defined
compute nodes and all that is required to initiate this process is to power
cycle each of the desired hosts.  On the Zeus cluster, each of the service
processors for the compute hosts are available via a separate network on the
Zeus cluster. You can point a web browser to their respective IPs to reboot, or
you can issue ipmi commands directly from the {\em master} cluster node.
