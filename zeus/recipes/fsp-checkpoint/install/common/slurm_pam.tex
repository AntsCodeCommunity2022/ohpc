One additional customization that is recommended is to restrict \texttt{ssh} access to
compute nodes to only allow access by users who have an
active job associated with the node. This can be enabled via the use of a
pluggable authentication module (PAM) provided as part of the SLURM package
installs. To enable with the {\em compute} image, issue the following:

% begin_fsp_run
% fsp_validation_comment Enbale slurm pam module
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={},upquote=true]
[master]$ echo "account    required     pam_slurm.so" >> $CHROOT/etc/pam.d/sshd
\end{lstlisting}
% end_fsp_run
