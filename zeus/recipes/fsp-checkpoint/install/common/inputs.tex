\noindent {\bf Inputs}: since this recipe details installing a cluster
starting from bare-metal, there is a requirement to define IP addresses and gather
hardware MAC addresses in order to support controlled provisioning. These values
are unique to the hardware being used, and this document uses \texttt{<variable>}
names in the command-line examples that follow to highlight where local site
inputs are required. A summary of the required variables used in this recipe
are as follows:

\vspace*{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{@{}>{\textbullet}cll@{}}
& \texttt{<nfs\_ip>}:    & IP address of NFS server providing \$HOME \\
& \texttt{<master\_ip>}: & IP address of the master server for the cluster
  being installed\\
& \texttt{<c1\_ip>}:     & IP address of first compute node \\
& \texttt{<c2\_ip>}:     & IP address of second compute node \\
& \texttt{<c1\_bmc>}:    & BMC address of first compute node \\
& \texttt{<c2\_bmc>}:    & BMC address of second compute node \\
\end{tabular}
