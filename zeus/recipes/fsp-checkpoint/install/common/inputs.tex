\noindent {\bf Inputs}: since this recipe details installing a cluster
starting from bare-metal, there is a requirement to define IP addresses and gather
hardware MAC addresses in order to support controlled provisioning. These values
are unique to the hardware being used, and this document uses \texttt{<variable>}
names in the command-line examples that follow to highlight where local site
inputs are required. A summary of the required variables used in this recipe
are as follows: \\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{@{}>{\textbullet}cll@{}}
& \texttt{<nfs\_ip>}    & IP address of NFS server providing \$HOME \\
& \texttt{<fsp\_repo>}  & IP address of FSP package repository \\
& \texttt{<master\_host>} & Local hostname of the chosen master server \\
& \texttt{<master\_ip>} & IP address of the master server \\
& \texttt{<c1\_ip>},\texttt{<c2\_ip>},\texttt{<c3\_ip>},\texttt{<c4\_ip>}
& Desired compute node addresses \\
& \texttt{<c1\_bmc>},\texttt{<c2\_bmc>},\texttt{<c3\_bmc>},\texttt{<c4\_bmc>}
& BMC addresses for computes \\
& \texttt{<c1\_mac>},\texttt{<c2\_mac>},\texttt{<c3\_mac>},\texttt{<c4\_mac>}
& MAC addresses for computes \\
\end{tabular}
